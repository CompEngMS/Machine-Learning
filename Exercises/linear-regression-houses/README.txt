Linear regression for 'houses' problem
======================================

This folder contains Octave/Matlab implementation of linear regression methods:
normal equation and gradient descent.
The file 'houses.txt' contains a data set for regression with two attributes.

Run 'houses_exercise' from the Octave/Matlab environments to see learning
and test phases.

Change the values of eta and num_iters and examine convergence of the gradient descent.
